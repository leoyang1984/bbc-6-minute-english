# Keeping kids off smartphones

This is [**Video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af7VzZTzmlg) link.

> **This is not a word-for-word transcript.**  
>
> *这不是逐字的文字稿。*  

> **Neil:**
> 
> Hello. This is 6 Minute English, from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.
>
> *尼尔：大家好。这里是BBC英语学习的六分钟英语。我是尼尔。*

> **Beth:**
> 
> And I'm Beth.   
>
> *贝丝：我是贝丝。*

> **Neil:**
> 
> Can I ask you something, Beth...? Beth? Hello, Beth? Are you listening?
>
> *尼尔：贝丝，我能问你点事吗？...贝丝？喂，贝丝？你在听吗？*

> **Beth:**
> 
> Oh, sorry, Neil! I was er... checking my Instagram, and ugh... Facebook...and, just sending this email... done! Now, what did you want?
> 
> *贝丝：哦，抱歉，尼尔！我刚刚在...查看我的Instagram，还有...Facebook...还在发一封电子邮件...好了！你想说什么？*

> **Neil:**
> 
> Well, I wanted to ask if you're getting addicted to your smartphone, but clearly the answer is 'yes'!
> 
> *尼尔：嗯，我本想问你是否沉迷于智能手机，但显然答案是"是的"！*

> **Beth:**
> 
> Actually, Neil, I am worried about my smartphone use, and it's not just me. Concerns are growing about the negative effect smartphones are having on adults and, even more, on children.
> 
> *贝丝：实际上，尼尔，我确实对自己使用智能手机的情况感到担忧，而且不仅仅是我。人们越来越担心智能手机对成年人，尤其是对儿童的负面影响。*

> **Neil:**
> 
> Studies show that girls who spend more time on social media are more likely to be anxious or depressed, and smartphones have also been linked to delayed brain development and poor sleep.
>
> *尼尔：研究表明，在社交媒体上花更多时间的女孩更容易焦虑或抑郁，智能手机还与大脑发育迟缓和睡眠质量差有关。*



> **Beth:**
> 
> Even so, around 60% of British eight-to-eleven-year-olds have a smartphone. So, in this programme, we'll be asking: are kids better off without a phone? And, of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.
> 
> *贝丝：尽管如此，大约60%的英国8至11岁儿童拥有智能手机。所以在本节目中，我们将探讨：没有手机对孩子们是否更好？当然，我们还会学习一些有用的新词汇。*

> **Neil:**
> 
> But first, put your phone away, Beth, because I have a question for you. The US has one of the highest levels of smartphone use, but according to a recent survey, how long does the average American 11-to-14-year-old spend looking at a screen every day? Is it:
a) five hours?
b) seven hours? or,
c) nine hours?**
> 
> *尼尔：不过首先，贝丝，请把你的手机放一边，因为我有个问题要问你。美国是智能手机使用率最高的国家之一，但根据最近的一项调查，11至14岁的美国青少年平均每天盯着屏幕多长时间？是：*
*a) 5小时？*
*b) 7小时？还是*
*c) 9小时？*

> **Beth:**
>  
> I'll guess American teens spend five hours a day on screens.
> 
> *贝丝：我猜美国青少年每天花5小时盯着屏幕。*

> **Neil:**
> 
> OK, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme. BBC journalist, Myra Anubi has a nine-year-old daughter who desperately wants her own phone. But Myra isn't convinced, as she explained to BBC World Service programme, 'People Fixing the World':
> 
> *尼尔：好的，贝丝，我稍后会在节目中公布答案。BBC记者Myra Anubi有个9岁的女儿，非常想要一部自己的手机。但Myra并不赞同，正如她在BBC国际广播节目"人们在改变世界"中解释的那样：*

> **Myra Anubi:**
>
> I'm worried about how much time she'll spend on her own device and what she might even see there. I mean, she's only nine at the end of the day. But at the same time, I don't want her to feel left out because some of her friends already have smartphones, and there's a chance that she'll miss out on play dates or kids' trends, cat videos or online chats with her besties. So, I'm torn between wanting her to be in our world, and also letting her be in her own mini world with her friends.
> 
> *Myra Anubi：我担心她会在自己的设备上花多少时间，甚至可能看到什么。毕竟，她才9岁。但同时，我也不想让她感到被孤立，因为她的一些朋友已经有了智能手机，她可能会错过玩伴聚会或儿童潮流，看不到猫咪视频，也无法与她最好的朋友在线聊天。所以，我在希望她融入我们的世界和让她与朋友们在自己的小世界里之间感到矛盾。*

> **Beth:**
>
> Myra is worried about her daughter, and says, "at the end of the day, she's only nine". Myra uses the phrase, at the end of the day, to mean after everything is considered.
> 
> *贝丝：Myra担心她的女儿，并说"归根结底，她才9岁"。Myra使用"at the end of the day"这个短语，意思是"考虑所有因素之后"。*

> **Neil:**
>
> Myra's daughter wants to chat with her besties – her best friends. But Myra worries she'll get hooked on social media, see harmful content, or spend too long online. Myra is torn between letting her daughter get a phone and not. If you're torn between two things, you can't decide between two possibilities, leaving you feeling anxious.
>
> *尼尔：Myra的女儿想和她的闺蜜（最好的朋友）聊天。但Myra担心她会沉迷于社交媒体，看到有害内容，或者在网上花太多时间。Myra在是否让女儿拥有手机的问题上感到矛盾。如果你在两件事之间感到矛盾，就是无法在两种可能性之间做出决定，这会让你感到焦虑。*

> **Beth:**
> 
> Parents like Myra are having to make an impossible choice – either give their children potentially harmful devices, or risk alienating them from their friends who do have smartphones.
> 
> *贝丝：像Myra这样的父母不得不做出一个艰难的选择 - 要么给孩子们可能有害的设备，要么冒着让他们与拥有智能手机的朋友疏远的风险。*

> **Neil:**
>
> In February 2024, mums Daisy Greenwell and Clare Fernyhough, started a WhatsApp group encouraging parents to not give their child a smartphone until the age of 14, with no social media access until 16. Soon, the phone-free group of families grew into a movement, 'Smartphone Free Childhood'. Here, mum, Daisy Greenwell, explains more to BBC World Service's, 'People Fixing the World':
> 
> *尼尔：2024年2月，两位妈妈Daisy Greenwell和Clare Fernyhough创建了一个WhatsApp群，鼓励父母在孩子14岁之前不给他们智能手机，16岁之前不允许使用社交媒体。很快，这个无手机家庭群发展成为一场运动，名为"无智能手机童年"。这里，妈妈Daisy Greenwell在BBC国际广播的"人们在改变世界"节目中做了更多解释：*

> **Daisy Greenwell:**
>
> Everyone I spoke to said, 'Yes, it's a nightmare getting your child a phone, but you've got no choice. You have to because everyone else is doing it. You can't leave them on their own'. So, Clare and I decided to start a WhatsApp group to support each other, and I posted about it on social media, and it went viral. The group is full so we encourage people, start one in your region, in your county, and they sprung up all over the country right in front of our eyes. It was amazing! And now there's over 100,000 people in the UK who are in our community.
> 
> *Daisy Greenwell：我跟每个人聊天时，他们都说，"是的，给孩子买手机是一场噩梦，但你别无选择。你必须这么做，因为其他人都这么做了。你不能让他们孤立无援"。所以，Clare和我决定创建一个WhatsApp群来互相支持，我在社交媒体上发布了这件事，结果迅速传播开来。群很快就满了，所以我们鼓励人们在自己的地区、自己的郡开始新的群组，它们在我们眼前在全国各地涌现出来。太神奇了！现在英国有超过10万人加入了我们的社区。*

> **Beth:**
>
> At the start, Daisy says it was a nightmare - a very unpleasant situation. Everyone else's kids had a phone, and Daisy didn't want her children to feel left out. But soon, more families got involved, and the group went viral, it spread quickly and widely on the internet and social media.
> 
> *贝丝：一开始，Daisy说这是一场噩梦 - 一个非常不愉快的情况。其他人的孩子都有手机，Daisy不想让自己的孩子感到被排斥。但很快，更多家庭参与进来，这个群在网络和社交媒体上迅速广泛传播开来。*

> **Neil:**
>
> Within months, new groups started up across Britain, right in front of Daisy's eyes. If you say something happens right in front of your eyes, you are emphasising that something surprising or unusual happened directly before you.
> 
> *尼尔：几个月内，新的群组在英国各地兴起，就在Daisy的眼前。如果你说某事发生在你眼前，你是在强调一些令人惊讶或不寻常的事情直接发生在你面前。*

> **Beth:**
>
> The Smartphone Free Childhood campaign has grown rapidly in schools, and there are now groups in 18 countries around the world, offering kids a circle of friends to play and chat with in the old-fashioned way: face-to-face. OK, why don't you reveal the answer to your question, Neil?
> 
> *贝丝："无智能手机童年"运动在学校迅速发展，现在全球18个国家都有相关群组，为孩子们提供了一个以传统方式玩耍和聊天的朋友圈：面对面交流。好了，尼尔，你为什么不公布你那个问题的答案呢？*

> **Neil:**
>
> Yes, I asked how long the average American teenager spends looking at a screen, and you guessed five hours a day, which was... the wrong answer, I'm afraid, Beth. It's actually even longer, around nine hours a day spent on screens. OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with the phrase, at the end of the day, meaning after all the relevant facts have been considered.
> 
> *尼尔：是的，我问了美国青少年平均每天盯着屏幕多长时间，你猜是5小时，但很遗憾，贝丝，这是错误答案。实际上甚至更长，大约每天9小时花在屏幕上。好，让我们回顾一下我们在本节目中学到的词汇，从短语"at the end of the day"开始，意思是"考虑所有相关事实之后"。*

> **Beth:**
>
> Your bestie is slang for your best friend.
> 
> *贝丝："bestie"是"最好的朋友"的俚语。*

> **Neil:**
>
> Someone who's torn between two things finds it difficult to choose between them, making them feel anxious.
> 
> *尼尔：一个在两件事之间感到矛盾的人很难在它们之间做出选择，这会让他们感到焦虑。*

> **Beth:**
>
> A nightmare is a very unpleasant experience or event.
> 
> *贝丝："nightmare"是一种非常不愉快的经历或事件。*

> **Neil:**
>
> If a video or story goes viral, it spreads quickly on the internet through social media and email.
> 
> *尼尔：如果一个视频或故事"goes viral"，就是通过社交媒体和电子邮件在互联网上迅速传播。*

> **Beth:**
>
> And finally, if you say something happened right in front of your eyes, you are emphasising that something surprising or unusual happened directly before you. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now!
> 
> *贝丝：最后，如果你说某事发生在"right in front of your eyes"，你是在强调一些令人惊讶或不寻常的事情直接发生在你面前。好了，我们的六分钟又到时间了。再见！*

> **Neil:**
>
> Bye!
> 
> *尼尔：再见！*
